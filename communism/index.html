	<h1>Communist Arguments</h1>
	<h2>(and why they are nonsensical angst and finger pointing)</h2>

	There are two main points communists I talk to bring up:
	<ol>
		<li>Real communism has never been tried.</li>
		<li>Communist countries were actually super successful, but those evil capitalists just screwed everything up.</li>
	</ol>

	
	<p>To answer the titular question though, you really have to consider what it takes to be a communist in the first place, and how communist politicians operate and what their real agenda is.</p>

	<p>First off, Karl Marx was not a real economist. His work basically amounts to a bunch of demagoguery where he points fingers at everyone and blames them for things not being the perfect utopia everyone dreams of. Never mind that he never worked a day in his life and had zero real-world experience to inform him of the realities of business.</p>

	<p>What Karl Marx called “capitalism” was in fact <em>mercantilism</em>, a pathologically bad economic ideology which even at the time of Marx’s writing had already been thoroughly criticized by the likes of Adam Smith and Frederic Bastiat. However, since Marx was not an economist he made no distinction between mercantilism and the economics described by Smith et al, instead lumping everything together and making the absurd moral statement that business owners are evil, greedy thieves who steal the productivity from their employees.</p>

	<p>Secondly, communism and socialism do not work in practice. At all. There are three major reasons for this.</p>

	<ol>
		<li>The Economic Calculation Problem.  This is a very complex subject that I would not do justice by explaining, but essentially, it highlights the reasoning behind economy as an ecosystem, not a hierarchy. Ludwig von Mises first proposed this problem, detailing how global values for individual objects, no matter how arbitrary or subjective, provide the necessary information for rational and objective allocation of resources in society.  He goes on to highlight how the concept of communism builds on a society that was created under the guise of capitalism.</li>
		<li>Incentives. When everyone is paid the same no matter what they do or how good a job they do, nobody wants to work at all so they do as little as possible and make no effort to correct mistakes. In a collective of workers where all are paid entirely equally, every individual's productivity drops to that of the slowest worker.</li>
		<li>Governments are incapable of producing anything, because governments are funded by the economy and without the economy a government is nothing more than a bunch of armed thugs.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>When you take those three things together, it is absolutely no surprise that communist/socialist countries always suffer from empty grocery store shelves, hyperinflation, and are dominated by firing squads and gulags.</p>

	<p>Finally, we get to the real issue here, which is that communist propagandists and politicians know that communism and socialism are incapable of working. Their end game is not communism or socialism, but feudalism (or some other form of government, or they have their own idea of what communism is and do not adhere to communism's ideals in their original form).</p>

	<p>They view communism as a buzz word and talking point of which the end result is their preferred style of government.  What they fail to realize however, is that they aren't smarter than every politician in capitalist country history;  When their policies fail, other idealists similar to themselves with equally warped and one-sided views on the world will have equal amounts of criticism and alternative ideas. It's a never-ending cycle of young idealists who think they've solved world issues.</p>

	<p>So what happens when these policies aren't the ideas that fix the world?  Well, we can just look at what previous communist leaders did.  Groups of radicalists who are prone to violence and will never admit the failures and shortcomings of their ideologies.</p>

	<p>"But that's not real communism! Those were corrupt leaders!"  Communism has been tried many many times.  It says something that it always begins and ends with less-than-ideal conditions, to say the least. If a certain idea always ends the same way, do you blame each individual implementation of the idea, and swear that the next time will be different (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEWJ-JgVS7Q">ever played Far Cry 3?</a>), or do you blame the idea? There will never be a perfect idea, but one has clearly worked while one has failed time and time again.  Capitalism isn't perfect, but that doesn't mean every alternative is a better solution.</p>

	<p>Ludwig von Mises, mentioned above in the Economic Calculation Problem, once wrote that a communist society would "flounder in the ocean of possible and conceivable economic combinations without the compass of economic calculation." Consider the construction of a new public structure, like a railroad. Before you even get into the most basic of questions, the very first one, should the railroad be built, is immediately challenged.  How can you run a cost-risk evaluation without the basic guidance of economic value? (the same can be said for other economic principles, such as the sunk-cost fallacy).</p>

	<p>The information and knowledge required to coordinate production and consumption subject to producers’ abilities, consumers’ preferences, and relative factor scarcity on a regional scale cannot be achieved without either a decentralized price system relying on private property and exchange or a centralized command-and-control apparatus; ie: no persisting large-scale “communist” society will be “real communism”.</p>

	<p>Another common talking point is that the United States diverted funding towards overthrowing communism because it was a viable alternative to capitalism, so the “inherently evil capitalists” shut it down, and this is the only reason communism hasn’t worked. But let’s break this argument down.</p>	

	<ul>
		<li>Claim: Communism would work if not for American/capitalist intervention</li>
		<li>Evidence: America overthrew communist movements</li>
		<li>Conclusion: If you stop something, that must mean it works well</li>
	</ul>

	<p>But, that doesn't really hold up, does it? The more logical, sane, and rational conclusion would be that the fact that those movements and groups got so dangerous that other countries had to intervene is a danger sign, not a reason to continue pursuing those groups’ ideologies. It just isn’t logical to assume that only things that work well warrant reactions.</p>

	<p>For example, if a toddler were to be teetering on the ledge of a building, that would certainly elicit a strong reaction from me, and I pull them off the ledge, is that because I’m terrified this brave new way of life would uproot my inherently evil way of life, or I’m worried serious harm could follow if I were not to intervene? It essentially boils down to “if x were so bad, then why do people work so hard to prevent it?” Which is a fallacy in it’s own right.</p>

	<p>The fact that communist/socialist governments either start out or eventually become Authoritarian or abusive is not to be ignored. It’s happened every time, and writing it off as a one off is supporting a very negative and foolhardy type of behaviour. Assuming that your preferred style of government is impervious to the failings and shortcomings of all other ones is not only ignorant, it is foolish and dangerous; it promotes a style of thinking that parallels blind loyalty.</p>

	<p>The fact remains that no nation in history has advanced from third world to developed nation status under communism. Every significant communist regime in history has jailed and killed dissidents in order to maintain its totalitarian control of its citizenry. Citizens actually living in a communist state had to be forcefully stopped in their criticism, and yet those living in their cushy lives in a first world, developed, capitalist nation have the gall to insinuate that these citizens just couldn't appreciate this obviously superior way of life? Communism has been tried, and <font size="+2">150 million</font> real people, with real lives, with real families, have lost their lives. Continuously advocating for such systems despite the downright shocking and terrible outcomes they've had in the past is moving much past ignorance; it is outright disrespectful and offensive.</p>

	<p>Most modern day communists dream of a <strong>utopia</strong>.  They look around them and see a system and world that has failed people at seemingly random, and that scares them. What they fail to realize is the world will <strong>never</strong> be perfect, no matter what societal structures or systems of government we reside under.  Furthermore, the solution certainly isn't advocating for socialist movements from the comfort of their house, in a capitalist city, enjoying fruits of capitalism such as secure food sources and innovation like smartphones, laptops, and PCs. To think that you know better than every first world leader on the planet and every soldier who suffered through inhuman conditions to protect the freedoms of people living under such repressive regimes is frankly grandiose. Centralized power will always be prone to corruption, yet having no central power makes our society no better than Neanderthal tribes.</p>
